# Size-and-ripen-based-fruit-sorting-machine
This prototype helps a fruit vendor to know the quality and quantity of the fruits according to their sizes and it doesnâ€™t require more equipment. This machine system is primarily made up of three main parts, the hopper, detector and receiver. The hopper holds and guides the fruits to the image processing unit (color sensor) located at the side of the tube where data is being read from the fruit and fed to the arduino for further processing and decision. The color sensor works by beaming white light on the fruits, other colors (components of light) except for colors corresponding to that on the surface of the fruits are absorbed, the rest (reflected colors of light) passes through the filters of the color sensor to the photodiodes and the frequency of each color is been read and sent to the Arduino. The Arduino measures the PWM of the received frequency in microseconds and makes a decision based on the parameters set by the programmer. Based on the decision of the Arduino on the data received, that if the fruit found to be unripen an instruction is sent to the top servo to open the door and fruit is fall into the outer tray and if the fruit found to be ripened bottom servo is opened and makes the fruit fall on the rods and then fruits are sorted according to their sizes i.e., (small, medium and large) a set of controlled mechanical movements by sorting and placing the fruit in the appropriate receiver.
